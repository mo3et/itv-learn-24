To use WebSocket in Golang for advanced purposes, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up a WebSocket Server**: You can use the standard `net/http` package in Golang to set up a WebSocket server. Here's a basic example to start with:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
	CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
		return true
	},
}

func wsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}
	defer conn.Close()

	for {
		// Read and write messages using conn
	}
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/ws", wsHandler)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

2. **Client-side Communication**: You can use JavaScript on the client-side to establish a WebSocket connection with the Golang server. Here's an example:


``` js
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws');

socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket');
};

socket.onmessage = (message) => {
  console.log('Received message:', message.data);
};

socket.send('Hello, WebSocket!');

```


3. **Handling Messages**: Inside the `for` loop in `wsHandler` function, you can read and write messages from the WebSocket connection `conn`. You can implement different logic based on the messages received.

4. **Advanced Features**: For advanced features like broadcasting messages to multiple clients, you can maintain a list of connections and iterate over them to send messages. You can also implement custom message formats, error handling, and security measures.

Remember to handle errors gracefully and ensure proper WebSocket closing mechanisms. This is just a basic outline to get you started with WebSocket in Golang. For more detailed implementations and best practices, you can refer to the Gorilla WebSocket library and official Golang documentation.
